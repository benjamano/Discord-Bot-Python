# Discord-Bot-Python
A simple Discord bot made using Python.

Annoyingly, I used to have a much more sophisticated version of this, but managed to lose it while using a faulty hard drive I robbed from an old TV.

This is a simple program designed to work with the discord.py library used to access Discord's bot API and create a bot.

I used to have a much more detailed version of this code with over 4000 lines of code, but managed to corrupt the hardrive holding it while downloading a game.

## To setup the bot:

Enter the Bot Token created in the discord developer portal, into the "Token" field, and it should hook onto it and run!
